 * Think stream like a pipeline through which our collection elements pass through
 * while passing various operations like filtering, sorting etc can applied
 * useful when bulk processing as it can do parallel processing
 * 
 * step1: create/open stream of collection
 * step2: add intermediate operations like filter, sorted, map, distinct etc
 * It transform one stream to another so that more operations can be applied
 * these are lazy operations -> gets executed only when terminal operation is invoked
 * step3: termination operation: collect, reduce, count etc.. , it will close the stream, no more operations can be added
 * original collection is affected, you'll get a new
