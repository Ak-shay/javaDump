/**
 * Thread Pool
 * It is a collection of threads aka workers, which are available to perform submitted tasks
 * Once completed, worker thread get back to thread pool and wait for a new task to assign
 * thread can be re-used
 * Thread creation takes time as certain memory needs to allocated (or some work has to be done)
 * but with thread pool, threads are already created and we can re-use them.
 * Thread creation is saved
 * Increase performance - more threads mean more context switching, 
 * using pool we have predefined num of threads
 * 
 * Tasks are put in queue, as soon as a thread is free, It gets assigned
 * 
 * java.util.Concurrent have a framework

/**
 * ThreadPoolExecutor(corePoolSize, maxSize, keepAliveTime, TimeUnit unit, workQueue, threadFactory, rejectedExecutionHandler)
 * helps to create customized thread pool
 * task queue size
 * first min Size thread will be spawned then later task will be put in queue
 * if queue is full then 1 more thread will be spawned if maxThread size is not reached
 * and that task will be taken care by the new thread
 * why not create thread first before filling queue? because idea of min threads is it is sufficient to perform, 
 * once all threads are created they will come back to pool, average thread wont be min in this case 
 * 
 * Lets say new task come and queue is full and the max thread has reach
 * This task will be rejected.
 * 
 * if any thread gets back, it will check queue and run
 * 
 * corePoolSize/min threads: num of threads initially created and keep in pool even if they are idle
 * 
 * allowCoreThreadTimeOut: property of ThreadPoolExecuter, default is false. If true, 
 * idle threads will be terminated if crosses keepAliveTime time sitting idle (applies to all threads in pool) if false extra threads will stay
 * 
 * unit: sec, hour, min, ms.. unit for keepAliveTime
 * 
 * blockingQueue: used hold task before they got picked up by worker threads
 * - boundedQueue - with fixed size (ArrayBoundedQueue)
 * - unboundedQueue - no fixed size (LinkedBlockingQueue)
 * 
 * threadFactory: factory for creating new thread, ThreadPoolExecuter uses this to create new thread.
 * provides interface to:
 * give custom thread name
 * set thread priority
 * set daemon flag
 * 
 * rejectedExecutionHandler: handler for the task that cannot be picked up by thread pool (when queue is full and maxThreads are created)
 * generally use for logging and debugging
 * 4 types of handler exists already
 *

 * Lifecycle of thread pool executer
 * running: accepting new tasks
 * Running -> shutdown (dont accept new task but finish existing running tasks and queue) -> terminated (all threads get eliminated)
